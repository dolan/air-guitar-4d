# Air Guitar Web Application Design Document

## Overview
This project aims to build a web-based air guitar application that leverages live video to generate guitar tones based on user hand movement. The system will use lightweight AI models running directly in the browser (e.g., Keras.js, TensorFlow.js) to analyze hand positioning, detect strumming motion, and translate these inputs into dynamic guitar sounds.

## Objectives
- Create an intuitive interface for users to "play" air guitar using their webcam.
- Accurately detect hand placement and strumming quality to influence pitch and tone.
- Implement guitar sound synthesis with adjustable tone selection.
- Ensure the application runs entirely in the browser for accessibility and ease of use.

## Key Features
- **Live Video Feed**: The user's camera will capture hand movement and strumming.
- **Hand Tracking**: AI-based detection of hand position, orientation, and movement.
- **Sound Synthesis**: Real-time audio generation based on detected motion.
- **Guitar Tone Selection**: Users can select from different guitar presets (e.g., electric, acoustic, bass).
- **Interactive Feedback**: Visual overlays and effects to guide the user in improving their technique.

## Technology Stack
### Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- WebRTC for live video streaming
- TensorFlow.js / Keras.js for AI-based hand tracking
- Tone.js for sound synthesis and audio control

### Backend (Minimal, if necessary)
- Node.js with Express (only if data persistence or external API access is required)

## System Architecture
```
[Webcam Feed] --> [Hand Tracking Model] --> [Motion Analysis] --> [Sound Engine (Tone.js)]
                                              |                     |
                                              |                     |
                                           [UI Feedback]     [Tone Selection UI]
```

### Detailed Components
#### 1. **Webcam Feed**
- Capture real-time video using `getUserMedia`.
- Preprocess the video for AI model input.

#### 2. **Hand Tracking Model**
- Use TensorFlow.js's PoseNet or MediaPipe Hands for hand tracking.
- Detect:
  - Finger position (to determine chord or note selection)
  - Strumming motion (to trigger guitar sounds)

#### 3. **Motion Analysis**
- Implement gesture recognition to map strumming speed and intensity to dynamic sound changes.
- Map hand position on an imaginary fretboard to adjust pitch and note selection.

#### 4. **Sound Engine (Tone.js)**
- Implement:
  - Distortion and reverb effects for electric guitar sounds.
  - Chord generation logic.
  - Dynamic pitch shifting based on hand position.

#### 5. **UI Feedback**
- Overlay markers to guide the user for accurate hand positioning.
- Visual cues for strumming intensity and technique.

#### 6. **Tone Selection UI**
- Simple dropdown or toggle system for selecting guitar tones and effects.

## User Flow
1. **Landing Page**: Introductory UI explaining the app with a "Start" button.
2. **Camera Setup**: Request webcam permissions and display video feed.
3. **Calibration Phase**: Instruct the user to place their hands for tracking calibration.
4. **Playing Mode**: Real-time guitar sound generation with visual feedback.
5. **Settings Panel**: Allow users to adjust guitar tone and effects.

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize AI model size for low latency (preferably < 5MB model size).
- Implement Web Workers to offload intensive computations.
- Use efficient audio generation libraries like Tone.js for minimal lag.

## Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|------------|-----------|
| Accurate hand tracking in varied lighting conditions | Use adaptive thresholding and dynamic background subtraction |
| Detecting complex strumming patterns | Implement gesture smoothing techniques to improve signal stability |
| Maintaining audio latency under 50ms | Utilize Web Audio API's low-level audio processing features |

## Development Strategy
Since this project will leverage ChatGPT and Cursor for development, there is no need for a structured project timeline. Development will proceed iteratively, focusing first on core functionality like hand tracking and sound synthesis, followed by refining the user experience, visual feedback, and performance tuning.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a recording feature to save performances.
- Introduce multiple instrument support (e.g., drums, bass).
- Implement multiplayer functionality for jam sessions.
